### Hi Devs!ðŸ‘‹
I'm a full-time student studying Business and Computer Science at the University of British Columbia. From coding in my bedroom to riding the Wall Street Bull in New York, I'm always looking for the next adventure! My passion for coding stems from learning Scratch in Grade 5 and has developed into learning lower level languages such as C and C++. 

This is my new Github account used to keep projects more organized. Feel free to reach out by connecting with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brian-soh/) or by sending me an email at [brian.soh.cs@gmail.com](mailto:brian.soh.cs@gmail.com).
